Obtain multiple written quotes for accurate pricing.Understand the difference between an estimate and a quote.Be mindful of prime cost items and their potential for added expenses. Provisional sums account for unforeseen project costs.

There are costs associated with your build, purchase or renovation. These are in addition to ACT Government fees.Be sure you understand which costs are and are not included in your contract.Getting quotesFor building and construction services, before requesting a quote from someone you are thinking of hiring:check to see if they charge for a quotecheck to see that they are qualified to provide the servicebe specific about the fittings, finishes (which include paint, grout, etc), appliances and floor coverings you want so you get a more accurate quoteprovide completed plans or specifications, if possibleGetting at least three written quotes before you decide who to hire is a good idea.There is a difference between a quote and an estimate.EstimateAn estimate is a reasonable assumption of the costs involved without knowing the exact extent of the work to be done or the exact costs of materials. An estimate, even if written, will not bind the person providing it to you, and you can end up paying more or paying for work you didn't expressly authorise.QuoteA quote is a legally enforceable document detailing all the work and parts or materials to be used. It should have a time limit for which the quote is valid. The quote should always be fixed and state how long it is fixed for. Quotes that are based on an hourly rate plus costs do not guarantee a set price.If you change your mind on what you want, write a list of the changes or have the plans re-drawn and ask for a re-quote.Prime cost and provisional sum itemsPrime cost itemsPrime cost items are those you may not have selected at the time of the contract. The contract sum includes an amount of money estimated to purchase the items. This allowance should be a reasonable estimate for a standard or average item. You must pay the price difference if you choose a more expensive item.Prime cost items can include:stovesheatingtilescarpetstapsbathroom fittingslight fittingsThe above list is not exhaustive. Prime cost items should be specified in the contract or listed in an attachment.To avoid disputes and additional costs at the end of your contract, keeping the number of prime cost items small is a good idea. Select other items upfront to know the actual cost before the work starts.Provisional sumA provisional sum is an amount of money included in the contract sum to cover work or materials where the extent needed cannot be precisely detailed when entering a contract. Typically, this may consist of site work costs, covering unforeseen circumstances such as rocks and materials in the earth that could not be reasonably detected before work starts.Related contentbuilding contractsbuilding certificationapprovalsland rates, duties and schemes

When you are hiring a builder and commencing building work, ensure the work is covered by a statutory warranty (where applicable).Know your rights and how to make a claim against your warranty if something goes wrong with your building work.

Statutory warrantyThe Building Act provides a statutory warranty for building work that is:on a residential buildingrequires a building approval; andhas a cost of $12,000 or more.This does not include structures you can’t live in such as swimming pools, driveways, and fences.The statutory warranty does not apply to work carried out by or for the Territory or the Commonwealth, or by a licensed owner–builder.ProvisionsThe warranty covers every contract for the sale of a residential building. Every contract to carry out residential building work to which the builder is a party (excluding owner–builder licence holders) is taken to contain a warranty. It does not need to be written into the contract for the warranty to be valid. Any provision in a contract that limits the statutory warranty is void.Under these provisions the builder warrants:That the residential building work has been or will be carried out in accordance with the Building Act.That the work has been or will be carried out properly and skilfully and: by the approved plans orif the work involves or involved handling asbestos or disturbing friable asbestos, in accordance with approved plans that comply with the Building Act about asbestos.That good and proper materials for the work have been or will be used in carrying out the work.If the work has not been completed, and the contract does not state a date by which, or a period within which, the work is to be completed, the work will be carried out with reasonable promptness.If the owner of the land where the work is being or is to be carried out is not the builder: The owner expressly makes known to the builder, or an employee or agent of the builder, the particular purpose for which the work is required or the result that the owner desires to be achieved by the work to show that the owner is relying on the builder’s skill and judgementthat the work and any material used in carrying out the work is or will be reasonably fit for the purpose or of such a nature and quality that they might reasonably be expected to achieve the result.The statutory warranty operates for:six years after the completion day for the residential building work about a structural element of a building, which includes components of external walls (including weatherproofing) andtwo years after the completion day for the work for residential building work in relation to a non-structural element of a buildingThe completion day is the day the work is completed or the day the contract relating to the work ends, whichever is later.The statutory warranties apply to any warranty the seller or builder may have provided.You do not have to be the original purchaser for the warranty to apply. You are entitled to the remainder of the warranty period if you purchase the building within the warranty period. For example, if you buy a building four years after completion, you will have the remaining two years on the statutory warranty for structural elements.Complaints and disputes If there is a dispute between you and your builder or other professional, there are options for you to resolve your dispute or make a complaint.Related contentbuilding contractsresidential building work insurancecertificationsduring constructionupon completion
